# Alternate Realities Project 2 - Priyam and Aayush

[Github Repo](https://github.com/priyamvadadaga/AltRealities-Project2)

As our second project for Alternate Realities we created an escape room that you can you interact with in VR to find clues to solve and escape the room. 

## Interactions
Throughout the project we used a number of interactors. We used ray interactors to teleport around the space, we used grab interactors to pick up the drill and use object collisions to interact with the screws on the vent.
